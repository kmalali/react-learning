            What to do
            1. Verify that new React element is created every second - use the globals els array and check its items - these are the React elements created over time.
            2. Verify that the DOM elements change only when there is a difference in the content etc. For this, get hold of DOM elements at various points in time (using document.querySelector() / document.getElementById() etc.) and store their references. Check that change in DOM ONLY for the time text element - that too for the text content ONLY - the DOM node remains the same even for this.
        -->
        <div id="root"></div>

        <script type="text/babel">
            let element, els = [];

            function tick() {
                element = (
                    <div>
                        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
                        <h2>It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
                    </div>
                );
                els.push( element );
                ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
            }

            setInterval(tick, 1000);

            Note: this page is a great way to try React but it's not suitable for production.
            It slowly compiles JSX with Babel in the browser and uses a large development build of React.

            To set up a production-ready React build environment, follow these instructions:
            * https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-a-new-app.html
            * https://reactjs.org/docs/add-react-to-an-existing-app.html

            You can also use React without JSX, in which case you can remove Babel:
