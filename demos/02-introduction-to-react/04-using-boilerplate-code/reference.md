# Using create-react-app to create a React-based project
create-react-app is a project boileplate code generator. It configures tasks and builds using webpack. All common taks including linting etc. come pre-configured.  

Install create-react-app globally and run it to create a project (say my-app) with boilerplate code. Once created, you can change to the project folder and run the app using the built-in web server (by running ```npm start```)
```
$ npm install -g create-react-app
$ create-react-app my-app
$ cd my-app
$ npm start
```
