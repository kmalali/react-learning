             * One important decision regarding state is which component we should store some particular data in.
             * If we need to store whether panel body is open or closed inside of a collapsible panel, then we need to question if only the panel body or even its siblings and other components up the component hierarchy would require it. The data regarding this state information needs to be stored at the nearest ancestor whose children require the state information and no other child of its parent (i.e except this compoent itself) requires the state information.
