# Exercises

1. Write a Component that displays a number (starting with 0) and allows user to increment and decrement it using 2 buttons. The buttons should be child components.

2. Add to the Timer component functionality to stop the timer - add a button clicking which stops the timer at the current time elapsed. Clicking start should restart it.

3. Make a collapsible panel component - we created a panel component earlier. The panel body should open or close when the panel heading is clicked.
