             * The JavaScript XML (JSX) syntax is used to write the template for a component in React. Though it looks like HTML, it REALLY IS closer to JavaScript (it is React's extension to the JS language).
             *
             * Paste this code in Babel online REPL and see how JSX gets transformed to JS
             * https://babeljs.io/repl/
             *
             * Note:
             * 1. The HTML attribute -> DOM node property name conversions like class -> className hold good in JSX too.
             * 2. ReactDOM.render() expects a React element as first argument. This means we need to wrap our JSX markup inside of a single container - else it would result in multiple React elements being created.
