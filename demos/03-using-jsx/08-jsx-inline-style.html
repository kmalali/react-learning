             * Inline styles are supplied using the style prop. The value of style in JSX is a JS object - it DOES NOT accept a string (this is enforced in order to prevent XSS attacks)
             * Rules for converting
             * 1. kebab-cased CSS properties are camelCased in style object used in JSX
             * 2. vendor-prefixed properties start with capital case except for Microsoft IE/Edge (-ms-transform becomes msTransform, but -webkit-transform becomes WebkitTransform)
             * 3, React will automatically append a "px" suffix to certain numeric inline style properties. If you want to use units other than "px", specify the value as a string with the desired unit.
             * 
             * Note: Auto-prefixing is NOT done for properties that have vendor-prefixed versions.
