            /**
             * What seems like native HTML elements like div, p, a, section, h1, header etc. are actually built-in React elements.
             * A React element is an instance of a React component, just like an HTML paragraph DOM node in an HTML document is an instance of the HTML paragraph class (called HTMLParagraphElement)
             * As we have seen, it is easier to create React elements using JSX rather than React.createElement() method.
             *
             * The React element is a plain JS object whose main property is "props" - an object with the "attributes" set on the element. The props has keys passed in via the second argument of createElement (the "props" argument). Additionally the children passed as trailing arguments are set on props.children.
             *
             * The type property of props gives the name of the element.
             * 
             * Note: ReactDOM.render() thus takes in as first argument a React element and NOT HTML element. It returns an instance of a steful component or null if rendered element is stateless.
