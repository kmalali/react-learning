             * React applications are structured using custom React elements and this is what gives them power!
             * A React component can be created using a function or a class. It is simpler to create it using a function, but class-based components have more features than function-based ones (class-based components have "state" and lifecycle methods which we will see later).
             * Custom component instances (elements) are created in JSX using the same syntax as built-in HTML equivalent components instances - you can use the self-closing tag syntax <CustomComponent /> if no content exists within the element or <Component></Component> if there is content within.
