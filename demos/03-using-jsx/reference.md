# JSX
JSX allows you to write markup in JS using HTML-like synta. This allows designers to contribute code. It enables the accessibility of templates for markup, combined with the power of JS.

JSX is an expression and can embed other JS expression within. After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects.

While using JSX isn't mandatory, it is almost always used for defining the markup.
