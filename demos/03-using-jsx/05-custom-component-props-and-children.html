             * To customize a Panel element we can use props and the children of the Panel element. These are available under the object passed to the component function (i.e. Panel()) as argument (usually named props.
             * The props are available directly inside props, and the children element are available under props.children. Using these allows us to customize our components.
             * 
             * "JSX expressions" enable use of JS variables inside of JSX markup. JSX expressions are provided within braces - {}. Any JS expression is also a JSX expression - for example, a string. However JSX can have other types of expressions too - for example, React elements (we will learn expressions in detail later).
