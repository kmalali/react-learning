            A script file will be treated as a module if it is included using type="module".
            A module can import other modules

            Notes
            * Since modules are fetched asynchronously, the file:// protocol will not work when loading this file - A web server is to be started and this file should be served via that server
            * Only very latest versions of modern browsers support JS modules - check out your browser's support for JS modules if this example does not work
